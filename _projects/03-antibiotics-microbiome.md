## Antibiotics, the Gut Microbiome, and Hidden Risks

Antibiotics save lives, but what do they leave behind in our gut? In two recent studies, my collaborators and I explored how antibiotics affect healthy adult microbiomes and the hidden reservoir of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within them.

### Key Findings

#### Antibiotic Scarring

Our first study found that even **short courses of antibiotics** cause a dramatic drop in gut bacterial diversity, known as "antibiotic scarring."

Key observations:
- Most microbiomes rebounded within two months
- **Azithromycin** delayed recovery, leading to lasting shifts in composition
- Some microbiomes ended up resembling those of ICU patients

### The Hidden Reservoir

The gut microbiome serves as a **reservoir for antimicrobial resistance genes**, even in healthy individuals who haven't recently taken antibiotics.

### Clinical Implications

These findings highlight the need for:
- **Responsible antibiotic use** - Even short courses have lasting effects
- **Microbiome monitoring** - Tracking recovery after antibiotic treatment
- **Probiotic research** - Developing strategies to restore microbiome health

*Antibiotics are deployed against bacterial pathogens, but their targeting of conserved microbial processes means they also collaterally perturb the commensal microbiome.*
