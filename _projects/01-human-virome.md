## Characterizing the Virus Inside Us

The NIH Common Fund Human Virome Program aims to characterize the many viruses that reside inside us without causing disease and to improve our understanding of how they impact human health.

### The Challenge

The human virome is large and diverse. However, excluding the relatively small number of viruses that cause obvious clinical disease, viruses are largely understudied, and their interaction and impact on human health are unknown.

### Technical Hurdles

Despite recent technological advances, significant challenges remain that have hindered progress:
- **Detection sensitivity** - Identifying viral sequences in complex samples
- **Contaminant removal** - Distinguishing true viral sequences from artifacts
- **Scalability** - Processing large-scale metagenomic datasets
- **Sample adequacy** - Ensuring representative sampling of viral communities

### Our Contribution

We are funded to build computational tools to identify **auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs)** in viruses from the human microbiome. These genes, acquired from their bacterial hosts, can modulate host metabolism and potentially influence human health.

*More details on this project coming soon!*
