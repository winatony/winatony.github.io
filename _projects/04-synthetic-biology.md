## Synthetic Biology for Value-Added Product Synthesis

**Rhodococcus opacus** has emerged as a microbial workhorse capable of transforming lignin—a waste product of plant biomass—into valuable biofuels and chemicals.

### Research Focus

Our research focused on enhancing this bacterium's ability to produce **triacylglycerols (TAGs)**, a key biofuel precursor, even under nitrogen-rich conditions.

### Key Achievements

#### Transcriptional Regulation
By overexpressing specific **transcriptional regulators**, we:
- Decoupled TAG production from nutrient limitation
- Boosted lipid yields on lignin-derived compounds
- Identified key regulatory networks controlling lipid metabolism

#### Genome-Scale Modeling
We developed a genome-scale metabolic model for *R. opacus*, named **iGR1773**, which:
- Accurately predicts metabolic fluxes using transcriptomic data
- Enables precise engineering strategies
- Optimizes biofuel production pathways

### Impact

These breakthroughs mark critical steps toward more efficient **lignin valorization**, turning industrial waste into sustainable fuels and chemicals.

By leveraging:
- Synthetic biology
- Metabolic modeling
- Genetic engineering

We're bringing the vision of cost-effective, second-generation biofuels closer to reality.
