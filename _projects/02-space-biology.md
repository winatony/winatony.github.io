## The BioS-ENDURES Consortium

The **BioS-ENDURES Consortium** (Biology in Space: Establishing Networks for Durable & Resilient Systems) is a NASA-funded collaboration among:
- University of Washington
- Washington State University
- Pacific Northwest National Laboratory

### Mission

Our mission is to advance space biology by focusing on **human-plant-microbiome interactions**, aiming to support sustainable human presence in low Earth orbit and beyond.

### Key Objectives

1. **Biomonitoring Tools** - Developing methods to monitor biological systems in space environments
2. **Predictive Models** - Creating computational models of organism interactions in microgravity
3. **Health Optimization** - Enhancing human and plant health through beneficial microbiome relationships

### Research Focus

Understanding how microbiomes adapt to space conditions is crucial for:
- Long-duration space missions
- Food production in space habitats
- Astronaut health maintenance
- Closed-loop life support systems
