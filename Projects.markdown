        The NIH Common Fund Human Virome Program aims characterize the many viruses that reside inside us without causing disease and to improve our understanding of how they impact human health. The human virome is large and diverse. However, excluding the relatively small number of viruses that cause obvious clinical disease, viruses are largely understudied, and their interaction and impact on human health are unknown. Despite recent technological advances, significant challenges remain that have hindered progress, including detection sensitivity, contaminant removal, scalability, and sample adequacy. We are funded to build tools to identify auxiliary metabolic genes in viruses from the human microbiome. More on this project coming soon!

        The BioS-ENDURES Consortium (Biology in Space: Establishing Networks for Durable & Resilient Systems) is a NASA-funded collaboration among the University of Washington, Washington State University, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Its mission is to advance space biology by focusing on human-plant-microbiome interactions, aiming to support sustainable human presence in low Earth orbit and beyond. Key objectives include developing biomonitoring tools, creating predictive models of organism interactions in space, and enhancing human and plant health through beneficial microbiome relationships.

Antibiotics are deployed against bacterial pathogens, but their targeting of conserved microbial processes means they also collaterally perturb the commensal microbiome. Anthony et al. 2022 <i>Cell Reports</i>.</font>

        Antibiotics save lives, but what do they leave behind in our gut? In two recent studies, my collaborators and I explored how antibiotics affect healthy adult microbiomes and the hidden reservoir of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within them.

        Our first study found that even short courses of antibiotics cause a dramatic drop in gut bacterial diversity, known as "antibiotic scarring." While most microbiomes rebounded within two months, azithromycin delayed recovery, leading to lasting shifts in composition. Alarmingly, some microbiomes ended up resembling those of ICU patients, highlighting the need for responsible antibiotic use​.<br />

## Unlocking Biofuel Potential with Rhodococcus opacus
In the push for renewable energy, Rhodococcus opacus has emerged as a microbial workhorse capable of transforming lignin—a waste product of plant biomass—into valuable biofuels and chemicals.

Our research focused on enhancing this bacterium’s ability to produce triacylglycerols (TAGs), a key biofuel precursor, even under nitrogen-rich conditions. By overexpressing specific transcriptional regulators, we decoupled TAG production from nutrient limitation, boosting lipid yields on lignin-derived compounds​.

To support these advances, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model for R. opacus, named iGR1773, which accurately predicts metabolic fluxes using transcriptomic data​. This model enables precise engineering strategies to optimize biofuel production pathways.

Additionally, we explored how engineered E. coli strains with altered fatty acid compositions can serve as platforms for diverse bio-based products, expanding the range of renewable chemicals​.

These breakthroughs mark critical steps toward more efficient lignin valorization, turning industrial waste into sustainable fuels and chemicals. By leveraging synthetic biology, metabolic modeling, and genetic engineering, we're bringing the vision of cost-effective, second-generation biofuels closer to reality​.

Renewable energy from waste is no longer a dream—it’s a work in progress.
