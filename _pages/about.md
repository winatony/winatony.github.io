subtitle: Data Scientist at PNNL
---

I am a **Data Scientist** with a passion for data science at the intersection of biology and machine learning. Currently, I work at the [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/) (PNNL) in Seattle, WA.

My research focuses on understanding complex biological systems through multi-omic approaches, combining metagenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics data to uncover insights about host-microbe interactions and microbial community dynamics.

## Current Research

- **Neurosymbolism and Knowledge Graphs for Bacterial Metabolism**: Co-Principle investigator developing neurosymbolic/knowledge graphs for biological discovery.
- **Laboratory Autonomy**: Biological investment advisor for the PNNL autonomy initiative. Implementing adaptive control for large-scale autonomous growth assays.
- **Microbiome Modeling**: Genome-scale modeling for identifying microbe-microbe interactions using *in silico* synthetic communities
- **Spatial Multi-omics**: Analyzing environmental stress effects on soil microbial communities

## Background

I earned my **Ph.D. in Computational Biology** from Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, where I studied with Dr. Gautam Dantas. My dissertation research focused on understanding the effects of antibiotics on the human gut microbiome and resistome.

Prior to my doctoral work, I was a Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School, studying aging in *C. elegans*, and earned my B.S. in Biology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
