      This project builds a comprehensive Knowledge Graph (KG) connecting gene - fitness - experiment triples to biological and experimental context. As a contributor,
      I helped develop the KG schema, data integration framework, and ensured the
      accuracy and completeness of biological annotations. The KG enables researchers to
      discover novel gene-experiment-phenotype relationships and accelerate hypothesis generation
      in systems biology research.
